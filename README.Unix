INTRODUCTION
============

WordGrinder is a simple, Unicode-aware word processor that runs on the
console. It's designed to get the hell out of your way and let you write;
it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen
markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember complex
key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.

WordGrinder does not require X. It runs in a terminal. 



INSTALLATION
============

WordGrinder needs the following packages installed:

 - ncursesw, the wide-character version of curses. This is supplied with
   most systems.
   
 - Lua 5.1, the programming language. This is available from:
     http://www.lua.org/
     
 - LuaFileSystem 1.2, the file system access extension to Lua. This is
   available from:
     http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/index.html

 - a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8. gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm
   and rxvt-unicode do. rxvt and the Linux console don't (unless you use
   jfbterm). You will also need a decent set of Unicode fonts or WordGrinder
   will look funny.
   
If you have Debian, you've already got all these. Merely install these
packages:

  libncursesw5-dev liblua5.1-0-dev liblua5.1-filesystem0
  

WordGrinder uses Prime Mover (http://primemover.sf.net) as its build system.
You do not need to install anything to make this work. You will, however, need
to configure the pmfile. Load it into an editor and follow the instructions;
there is very little that will need changing (nothing, if you're on Debian).  
  
Then, simply do:

  ./pm install
  
WordGrinder will build and install to the location you specified in the
pmfile. (If you specified a location that needs to be written to as root,
you will need to use sudo. If you don't like building things as root, you can
build and install in two stages by doing "./pm; ./pm install").

It is now ready to use.

REVISION HISTORY
================

WordGrinder 0.3.3rc2: 2009-12-07: Fixed a bug when searching for or replacing
strings containing multiple whitespace characters (that was triggering the
crash handler). Thanks to lostnbronx for the report. Added RAW and PRE
paragraph styles. Cleaned up HTML import. Add customisability to HTML export.
 
WordGrinder 0.3.2: 2008-11-03: Fixed a very simple and very stupid typo that
caused a crash if you tried to turn autosave on. Added a simple exception
handler to try and prevent data loss on error in the future.

WordGrinder 0.3.1: 2008-09-08: Minor bugfix revision to correct a few minor
but really embarrassing crashes problems in 0.3: no crash on HTML import, no
crash on File->New. Also some minor cosmetic fixes I noticed while doing the
work.

WordGrinder 0.3: 2008-09-07: Lots more bug fixes. Added LaTeX export; troff
export; next/previous word/character; table of contents; autosave; scrapbook;
Windows console port. Fixed some issues with key binding. Lua bytecode is now
embedded in the executable, making it self contained. --lua option. General
overhaulage.

WordGrinder 0.2: 2008-01-13: Lots of bug fixes. Added word count. Added about
dialogue.

WordGrinder 0.1: 2007-10-14: Initial release.
