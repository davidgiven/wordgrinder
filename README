INTRODUCTION
============

WordGrinder is a simple, Unicode-aware word processor that runs on the
console. It's designed to get the hell out of your way and let you write;
it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen
markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember complex
key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.

WordGrinder does not require a GUI. It can run in a terminal. (But there are GUI
versions for Unixishes, Windows and OSX if you want them.)



INSTALLATION
============

WordGrinder needs the following packages installed:

 - ninja, the build tool. This is available from:
     https://ninja-build.org/

 - ncursesw, the wide-character version of curses. This is supplied with
   most systems.

 - an OpenGL/GLFW development kit (if you want the OpenGL frontend).  This is
   supplied with most systems.

 - zlib. You will already have this, but just on the offchance, it's here:
     http://www.zlib.net/

 - Optionally: Lua, the programming language. WordGrinder has its own built-
   in copy, but if you want to use the system Lua, install it and edit the
   Makefile. Lua is available from:
     http://www.lua.org/
   WordGrinder will work with Lua versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 or LuaJIT.

 - a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8. gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm
   and rxvt-unicode do. rxvt and the Linux console don't (unless you use
   jfbterm). You will also need a decent set of Unicode fonts or WordGrinder
   will look funny.

Chances are you already have these in your distribution. Merely install these
packages:

  If you have Debian/Ubuntu:
    ninja-build libncursesw5-dev liblua5.3-dev zlib1g-dev libglfw3-dev

  If you have Fedora:
	lua lua-devel lua-libs lua-filesystem zlib-devel libglfw-devel ncurses
	ncurses-devel ninja-build

  If you have OSX with Homebrew:
    ninja pkg-config glfw

To detect a sensible configuration and build, simply do:

    make

To install into your home directory, do:

    sudo make install

If you want to install somewhere else, do:

	PREFIX=/usr/local ./configure
	make install

(Change PREFIX to whatever you like; naturally, if you're not installing in a
global location, you don't need sudo.)

(There are various other poorly-documented configuration options in the
configure script.)

It is now ready to use.

Special note for compilation on Windows: do 'make' from MSYS2 with the Mingw64
toolchain and nsis installed.  use Cygwin. You'll end up with the installer
package in bin/.

REVISION HISTORY
================

WordGrinder 0.9: 2021-XX-XX: threw away the X11 and Windows GDI frontends and
replaced them with OpenGL --- there's now a GUI version for OSX! New shiny
colour scheme and ruler layout kindly contributed by Pacrox. Also threw away and
replaced the build.lua file with something even worse. Added the ability to quit
WordGrinder by closing the window. Fixed a bug where the global settings would
be reset during CLI use.  WordGrinder files with CRLF line endings can now be
read. Emacs orgmode export (contributed by VitorGoatman@github). ESCAPE can be
used to cancel things. Both TAB and ^I can be used for autocompletion in file
dialogues. Miscellaneous editor state machine bugfixes. Multiple scroll modes.
Changed the cursor shape for visibility. Use the system clipboard where
possible. Added mouse support.

WordGrinder 0.8: 2020-10-13: started out as a bugfix release but then I got
carried away. New features: a paragraph style for numbered bulletpoints; more
look-and-feel options; the caret now flashes; basic template support; word
count display of selected text; custom autosave directory; autocompletion in
file dialogues; Windows console version; recent documents list; Markdown
import. Bugfixes: lots of import and export fixes (and tests so that they stay
fixed); spellchecker fixes; selection position fixes; keyboard entry fixes on
Windows; graphics fixes on Windows; filesystem fixes on Windows; assorted other
minor tweaks.

WordGrinder 0.7.2: 2018-11-29: bugfix release. Pasting immediately after
loading a document no longer hard crashes. Don't buffer overrun if given
invalid unicode. Global settings are now updated correctly (in several
places). Fix a data loss situation when saving fails.

WordGrinder 0.7.1: 2017-11-02: correct and cleaner license reporting;
rearrange the source so that we can avoid shipping upstream dependencies
if we want. No actual code changes.

WordGrinder 0.7: 2017-10-30: new plain text diffable file format; Lua 5.3
support; better locale detection; dense paragraphs mode; lots of bugfixes.
Official OSX support. New (better, hopefully) build system.

WordGrinder 0.6: 2015-04-18: New X11 frontend (actual bold and italic on
Linux machines!); shift+cursor keys starts a selection; more HTML emission
fixes; non-document persistent settings; global key maps (currently via a
configurationfile); search works properly across words with markup; italic
display in a terminal (if you have a new enough version of ncurses); more
traditional charstyle selection (you can press ^B at the beginning of words
now!); more traditional selection model (shift+cursor keys works now!); fix
crash on loading very large .wg files; smart quote support; more efficient
files; undo and redo; spellchecker; colour configuration on X11 and Windows;
MarkDown export.

WordGrinder 0.5.2.1: 2015-02-21: Minor bugfixes: build system fixes; updated
minizip to a version which builds better on Ubuntu; OSX Homebrew build system;
delete word; subsection counts now correct; HTML PRE emission issue corrected.

WordGrinder 0.5.1: 2013-12-08: Major overhaul: fixed hideous file corruption
bug; much improved Windows text renderer; bold; page count; widescreen mode;
UI style overhaul; many other minor bugfixes. Many thanks to Connor Karatzas
for extensive Windows testing.

WordGrinder 0.4.1: 2013-04-14: Minor bugfixes and build optimisation in aid
of the Debian package.

WordGrinder 0.4: 2013-03-24: Major overhaul: OpenDocument import/export,
new much smaller file format, a proper Windows port, updated to Lua 5.2,
switched away from Prime Mover to make (sob), much bug fixage.

WordGrinder 0.3.3: 2009-12-13: Fixed a bug when searching for or replacing
strings containing multiple whitespace characters (that was triggering the
crash handler). Thanks to lostnbronx for the report. Added RAW and PRE
paragraph styles. Cleaned up HTML import. Add customisability to HTML export.
Relicensed to MIT.

WordGrinder 0.3.2: 2008-11-03: Fixed a very simple and very stupid typo that
caused a crash if you tried to turn autosave on. Added a simple exception
handler to try and prevent data loss on error in the future.

WordGrinder 0.3.1: 2008-09-08: Minor bugfix revision to correct a few minor
but really embarrassing crashes problems in 0.3: no crash on HTML import, no
crash on File->New. Also some minor cosmetic fixes I noticed while doing the
work.

WordGrinder 0.3: 2008-09-07: Lots more bug fixes. Added LaTeX export; troff
export; next/previous word/character; table of contents; autosave; scrapbook;
Windows console port. Fixed some issues with key binding. Lua bytecode is now
embedded in the executable, making it self contained. --lua option. General
overhaulage.

WordGrinder 0.2: 2008-01-13: Lots of bug fixes. Added word count. Added about
dialogue.

WordGrinder 0.1: 2007-10-14: Initial release.
