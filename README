INTRODUCTION
============

WordGrinder is a simple, Unicode-aware word processor that runs on the
console. It's designed to get the hell out of your way and let you write;
it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen
markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember complex
key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.

WordGrinder does not require X. It runs in a terminal. 


INSTALLATION
============

WordGrinder needs the following packages installed:

 - ncursesw, the wide-character version of curses. This is supplied with
   most systems.
   
 - Lua 5.1, the programming language. This is available from:
     http://www.lua.org/
     
 - LuaFileSystem 1.2, the file system access extension to Lua. This is
   available from:
     http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/index.html

 - the iconv character set conversion library. This is shipped automatically
   with most glibc-based systems.
   
 - a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8. gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm
   and rxvt-unicode do. rxvt and the Linux console don't (unless you use
   jfbterm). You will also need a decent set of Unicode fonts or WordGrinder
   will look funny.
   
If you have Debian, you've already got all these. Merely install these
packages:

  libncursesw5-dev liblua5.1-0-dev liblua5.1-filesystem0
  

WordGrinder uses Prime Mover (http://primemover.sf.net) as its build system.
You do not need to install anything to make this work. You will, however, need
to configure the pmfile. Load it into an editor and follow the instructions;
there is very little that will need changing (nothing, if you're on Debian).  
  
Then, simply do:

  ./pm install
  
WordGrinder will build and install to the location you specified in the
pmfile. (If you specified a location that needs to be written to as root,
you will need to use sudo. If you don't like building things as root, you can
build and install in two stages by doing "./pm; ./pm install").

It is now ready to use.
