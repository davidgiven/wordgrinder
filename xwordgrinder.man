.SH NAME
xwordgrinder \- Xlib-based word processor



.SH SYNOPSIS

.B wordgrinder
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ filename ]



.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xwordgrinder
is a simple character cell word processor that runs on X11. It is
primarily designed for text entry. It's designed to get the hell out of
your way and let you write; it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports Unicode, basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen
markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember complex
key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.

When running, pressing ESC (or ALT + menu shortcut key) will open the menu.



.SH OPTIONS

These options follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.

.TP
.BI \--lua\  filename
Loads and executes a Lua file instead of starting normally.

.TP
.BI \--convert\  srcfile\ destfile
Converts from
.I srcfile
to
.I destfile
and then exits.

The type of the file is autodetected from the extension of the filename. The
source file may have a document name suffixed with a
.I :
for use when importing or exporting WordGrinder files.

.TP
.BI \--config\  file.lua
Sets the name of the user config file.

.TP
.B --recent
On startup, loads the most recent file edited by WordGrinder. If there is no
most recent file, you get an empty document.


.SH CONFIGURATION

The user config file is a Lua file which is loaded and executed before
the program starts up. It defaults to:

.TP
.B ~/.wordgrinder/startup.lua
